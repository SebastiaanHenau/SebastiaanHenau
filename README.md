## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm programming teacher at the Thomas More University of Applied Sciences in Belgium where I mostly teach JavaScript related courses. 

### Projects

Here you can find some of the projects I've worked on.

#### GitPub

[https://gitpub.sebastiaanh.com/](https://gitpub.sebastiaanh.com/) is a tool which allows you to publish parts of a private repository as a public repository. This is usefull for teachers who use a single repository which contains examples, assignments, solutions to assignments, exams, admin tools, ... It is obvious that not all of these folders should be available to students. Through GitPub you can publish only those parts which a student should be allowed to see.
